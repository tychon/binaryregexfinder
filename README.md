# binary regex finder

This is a very small script I wrote for a friend who severely damaged
his filesystem but really needed some TeX files.  Luckily he began all
his TeX with a header, so it's really easy to look for that in the raw
binary data of the device.

Usage is described in `regexfind.py`
